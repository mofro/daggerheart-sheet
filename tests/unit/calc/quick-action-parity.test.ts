/**
 * THE Quick Action conversion proof.
 *
 * tests/unit/fixtures/quick-action-parity.json was captured by running
 * computeAll at the PRE-conversion HEAD (toggle-driven calc) across the
 * matrix in qa-parity-matrix.ts — 41 cases covering every legacy toggle
 * alone, the two-stage toggles at each stage, class-level edges (paladin
 * 0/5/11, monk 0/10/11), panache gating, all 11 weapon songs, ranged
 * styles (Longbow/Shuriken/Ray), and stacking-trap combos (enhancement
 * weapon + Enhancement song; haste + flurry + power attack).
 *
 * Both post-conversion paths must reproduce those outputs byte-for-byte:
 *  1. the pre-v6 fallback (quickActions absent -> toggles drive the calc)
 *  2. the converted path (toggles seeded into quick actions, then zeroed)
