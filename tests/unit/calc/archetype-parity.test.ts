/**
 * Parity guard for the archetype feature: characters with NO archetypes
 * selected must produce byte-identical computeAll output as the system
 * evolves. History: snapshots were first captured before any wiring; the
 * TWO sanctioned regenerations were the hardcoded-archetype relocations:
 *  1. Virtuous Bravo AC (calc/ac.ts granted the Nimble dodge bonus to
 *     every paladin — diff reviewed: normalAC/touchAC/cmd −bravo bonus
 *     on the two paladin fixtures, nothing else).
 *  2. Scaled Fist AC (calc/ac.ts keyed the monk AC bonus off CHA for
 *     every monk — diff reviewed: the plain-monk fixture's AC/cmd move
 *     from the CHA-based to the RAW WIS-based bonus, nothing else).
 *  3. computed.speed added (race speed/size wiring) — diff reviewed:
 *     every fixture gains the additive `speed` object; no existing key
 *     changed (no raceKey on these fixtures, so speed derives from the
 *     manual "30ft" string exactly as InitSpeed rendered before).
 *  4. attacks.parts added (combat-tab two-row layout) — diff reviewed:
 *     every fixture gains the additive `parts` object (structured
 *     standard/full/damage/crit/touch behind the existing strings); the
 *     melee/ranged/unarmed strings are byte-identical, nothing else moved.
 *  5. resourceMaxes added (Route A — live class-pool maxima) — diff
 *     reviewed: every fixture gains the additive `resourceMaxes` object
 *     (class/archetype pool id → derived max); no existing key changed.
 *     Fighter4 gets an empty object (no class pools).
 *  6. resourceFormulas added (read-only class-formula display) — diff
 *     reviewed: every fixture gains the additive `resourceFormulas` object
 *     (pool id → human-readable formula string); no existing key changed.
 *     Fighter4 gets an empty object (no class pools).
 *  7. resourceFooters added (calculated footers) — diff reviewed: every
 *     fixture gains the additive `resourceFooters` object (pool id → live
 *     footer string), empty for all four (no fixture sets a footerFormula);
 *     no existing key changed.
 * From here on these are frozen again.
